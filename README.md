•	Code base for the final capstone assignment.

•	Students are required to think of a business problem, gather and clean data to prepare the data set. Next, chose a machine learning algorithm to do data analysis and gather insights into the business problem and provide recommendations.

•	For this project, I have chosen the topic- Opening a Bubble tea shop in Singapore.
